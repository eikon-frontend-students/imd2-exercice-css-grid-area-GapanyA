            Architecture that respects both human needs and environmental
            responsibility
          </h2>
          <p>
            At Meridian Architects, we believe that exceptional design emerges
            from the intersection of human experience and environmental
            stewardship. Our practice specializes in creating buildings that not
            only serve their intended purpose but also contribute positively to
            their communities and ecosystems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through careful material selection, passive design strategies, and
            innovative construction techniques, we develop architectural
            solutions that minimize environmental impact while maximizing
            spatial quality and user comfort.

            <h3>Hillside Residence</h3>
            <p>
              This 3,200 sq ft single-family home integrates into the natural
              topography through a series of terraced volumes. Cross-laminated
              timber construction and passive solar orientation reduce energy
              consumption by 60% compared to conventional homes.

              while maintaining privacy through strategic landscaping.

            <p>
              A 45,000 sq ft mixed-use development housing tech startups and
              research facilities. The building features a double-height atrium
              with natural ventilation, reducing mechanical cooling loads.
              Reclaimed brick facade and green roof systems create habitat
              corridors while managing stormwater runoff. Flexible floor plates
              accommodate changing tenant needs.

            <p>
              This 12,000 sq ft public library serves as a neighborhood anchor
              through its accessible design and community programming spaces.
              Clerestory windows provide abundant natural light while minimizing
              glare on reading surfaces. Local stone and mass timber
              construction celebrate regional materials and craftsmanship
              traditions.

            <h3>Affordable Housing Development</h3>
            <p>
              A 48-unit residential complex providing dignified,
              energy-efficient housing for working families. Prefabricated
              construction methods and shared community spaces reduce costs
              while fostering social connections. Photovoltaic arrays and
              greywater systems achieve net-zero energy performance across the
              development.

              Interior gardens, natural materials, and optimized daylighting
              create calming environments. High-performance building envelope
              and radiant heating systems ensure year-round comfort with minimal
              energy use.

            <h3>Urban Infill Housing</h3>
            <p>
              A collection of four townhomes maximizes density on a narrow urban
              lot while maintaining neighborhood character. Shared courtyards
              and rooftop gardens create private outdoor space within the urban
              context. Modular construction and standardized details reduce
              construction waste and delivery time.
